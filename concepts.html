                MHRD Design-centred innovation is a force multiplier that can help the country move up the value chain,
                making Indian industry globally competitive. In this context, Ministry of Human Resource Development
                proposes to launch a National Initiative for Design
                Innovation in the Twelfth Plan. Under this initiative, 20 new Design Innovation Centres (DIC), one Open
                Design School (ODS) and a National Design Innovation Network (NDIN), linking together all these schools,
                would be set up. ODS would ensure
                maximum reach of design education and practice in the country through various collaborative education
                programmes (linking a broad spectrum of educational institutions), and free sharing of its courseware through the Internet. NDIN would be a network of design schools that work closely with other leading
                institutions of industry and academia, NGOs and government to further the reach and access of design
                education, to pro-mote design innovation in all sectors, and
                to develop wide-ranging collaborative projects between institutions. ODS and NDIN would also raise
                the standards of design education and innovation in the country through various initiatives
                including the creation of fabrication labs and
                digital media zones across educational institutions on a large scale. Design Innovation Centre (DIC)
                is a project of the Gujarat Technological University (GTU) funded by Department of Higher Education,
                Ministry of Human Resource Development,
                Government of India in May 2018. The Gujarat Technological University, DesignInnovationCentre is to
                provide a platform to students, faculty members and researcher having enthusiastic for learning and
                creativity, and passion to convert
                their ideas into design innovations.
